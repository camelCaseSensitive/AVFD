                <h2>Oral Exams and Screenings</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">During a routine cleaning appointment you will have a complete oral exam and cancer screening.  The dentist or hygienist will thoroughly evaluate the health of your mouth and perform a complete head and neck exam.  We will look for signs of oral cancer and feel the area under your jaw, the sides of your neck, and the insides of your lips and cheeks, as well as examine the sides of your tongue and the roof and floor of your mouth.  We will likely discuss your diet and oral hygiene habits and demonstrate proper home care techniques.</p>

                <h2>Cleaning</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">A professional cleaning, also known as prophylaxis, is literally a preventive treatment of a disease. It is necessary to remove plaque, calculus (tartar), and stains from the teeth and from underneath the gums. Cleaning is especially effective in areas that are difficult to reach in routine toothbrushing. It is recommended that most patients have their teeth cleaned twice per year. Some individuals may benefit from more frequent cleanings. More frequent cleaning and examination may also be necessary during treatment of dental and other oral disorders.</p>
                <p class="text-wrap">Dental cleaning promotes good oral hygiene. This is important not only for your smile, but for your overall health as well. Gum disease can lead to tooth loss and is a factor in other medical conditions including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and pregnancy. A healthy mouth is essential to general health.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>X-Rays</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Dental x-rays show cavities, bone loss, hidden dental structures (like wisdom teeth), and anything that may differ from normal anatomy. These pictures are important to provide information that cannot be seen on a visual exam. They help us find and treat dental problems early. This can potentially save money, unnecessary discomfort, and possibly your life.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Cone Beam - 3D Imaging</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Cone Beam Computer Tomography is an advanced 3D imaging technique similar to a CAT scan that allows the doctors to visualize the teeth and jaws in great detail. Compared to a CAT scan, a CBCT scan involves significantly less radiation and takes only a few minutes to capture. The amount of detailed information gathered in these scans is imperative for the treatment planning for implant placement as well as localization and characterization of oral pathology, such as dental infections, bony defects, cysts and even different types of cancer.</p>

                <h2>Athletic Mouth Guard</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Use of a mouth guard for all contact sports minimizes the risk of broken teeth and injuries to an individual's lips, tongue, face, and jaw.  By providing a cushion, a mouth guard can help to prevent a potentially painful and expensive accident from occurring.  We strongly encourage the use of mouth guards for many sports.  These include basketball, soccer, football, baseball, lacrosse, hockey, and wrestling.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Night Guard</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Teeth withstand an incredible amount of force during normal chewing and functioning. Habits such as grinding or clenching during sleep put additional forces on the teeth that can result in tooth wear or fracture. A mouth guard is a great way to help protect your natural teeth as well as any restorative dental work that you have had..</p>
