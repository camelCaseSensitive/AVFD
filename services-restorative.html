                <h2>Sealants</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Sealants are a thin, plastic filling material that is painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth. It is usually the back teeth (the premolars and molars), to help prevent tooth decay. The sealant bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth, forming a protective shield over the deep groves in the enamel of each tooth. Applying a sealant is a simple and painless process. It takes a few minutes for the dentist to apply the sealant to seal each tooth. The application steps are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="text-wrap">
                        <li>First the teeth that are to be sealed are thoroughly cleaned.</li>
                        <li>Each tooth is then dried, and cotton or another absorbent material is put around the tooth to keep it dry.</li>
                        <li>Each tooth is then dried, and cotton or another absorbent material is put around the tooth to keep it dry.</li>
                        <li>An acid solution (we call it a shampoo!) is put on the chewing surfaces of the teeth to etch the surface which allows the sealant to bond to the teeth.</li>
                        <li> The teeth are then rinsed and dried.</li>
                        <li>Sealant is then painted on the tooth.  A special curing light is used to harden the sealant.</li>
                        <li>Sealants can protect teeth from decay for up to 10 years, but they need to be checked for chipping or wearing at regular dental check-ups. Your dentist can replace sealants as necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div >
            <div class="text-nowrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Fillings</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">We utilize a tooth-colored material (composite resin) to restore decayed teeth back to form and function.  We no longer use silver amalgam for fillings-restorations.</p>
                <p class="text-wrap">Our practice is highly prevention-oriented.  Our philosophy is to help our patients avoid dental decay through education on good hygiene and diet counseling.  We also promote the use of products that help decrease decay.  Dental restorations are required when tooth decay has caused a cavity to form on a tooth surface.  This cavity may progress to a more severe problem, such as a root canal, if left untreated.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Dental Bonding</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Dental bonding is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin (a durable plastic material) is applied and hardened with a special light, which ultimately "bonds" the material to the tooth to restore (fill cavity) or improve your smile.</p>

                <p class="text-wrap">Dental bonding is an option that can be considered for the following:</p>
                <ul class="text-wrap">
                    <li>repair decayed teeth (composite resins are used to fill cavities)</li>
                    <li>repair chipped or cracked teeth</li>
                    <li>improve the appearance of discolored teeth</li>
                    <li>close spaces between teeth</li>
                    <li>make teeth look longer</li>
                    <li>change the shape of teeth</li>
                    <li>as a cosmetic alternative to amalgam fillings</li>
                    <li>protect a portion of the tooth's root that has been exposed when gums recede</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Scaling/Root Planing</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Scaling and root planing is a procedure to remove calculus (tartar) deposits underneath the gums and on the root surfaces of the teeth.  Calculus (tartar) on the root surfaces of the teeth causes inflammation in the gum tissues.  Over time, this inflammation results in the loss of bone support for the teeth.  This process is a bacterial infection that can jeopardize the teeth if left untreated.  The same bacteria that cause this gum disease can also cause heart problems.  The Scaling/Root Planing procedure may be recommended if it has been a long time since your last cleaning or you have developed gum disease.  A local anesthetic may be used to help make the procedure comfortable for you and an antibiotic powder may be placed in the pockets underneath your gums to help with healing and prevent infection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Root Canal</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Root canal treatment (also called a root canal) is necessary when soft tissue inside the tooth containing blood vessels and nerves becomes inflamed or diseased.  This tissue, known as pulp, is removed and the canal is cleaned, disinfected and filled.  If a tooth has an abscess, a root canal necessary to treat the infection. This procedure can relieve toothache, stop infection, and promote healing.  After the treatment is complete, a crown is strongly recommended to preserve the tooth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Crowns</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">A dental crown is a tooth-shaped "cap" that is placed over a tooth -- to cover the tooth.   It restores a tooth's shape, size, strength, and improves its appearance.  The crowns, when cemented into place, fully encase the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. Crowns are used in many different applications. Typically, the tooth has been broken or severely damaged by decay. As a result, a filling cannot replace enough of the tooth or make the tooth strong enough.  A crown may also hold together parts of a cracked tooth or be used to hold a bridge in place. Crowns can be used to improve appearance as well. They may be placed to cover misshapen or badly discolored teeth.</p>
                <p>At Avon Village Family Dentistry, we are proud to offer CEREC restorations for many of these situations.  With this exciting technology, a model of each patient's teeth is made using a digital video camera.  The crown is designed on the computer and sent to a milling machine right in our office.  These crowns are beautiful, long-lasting, and replicate the natural anatomy and function of a tooth.  Best of all, the entire process is completed in ONE visit!</p>

                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">A dental implant is a small titanium post that is surgically anchored in the jaw to replace a missing tooth.  After healing, when the implant fixture has integrated in the bone, a crown (tooth) is built on top of the post.  Implants offer an excellent solution for the replacement of a missing tooth.  They also can be used to replace multiple missing teeth as well as to support and stabilize dentures.  At Avon Village Family Dentistry, we perform the surgical placement of many dental implants or work in coordination with a local oral surgeon in some cases.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Dentures</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Dentures are appliances that can replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues.  They can replace some or all teeth and can help to restore your smile.  This appliance can be used to help fill out the appearance of your face and profile, and can be made to closely resemble the look of natural teeth.
                <p class="text-wrap">Dentures can help patients through:</p>
                    <ul class="text-wrap">
                        <li>Mastication, as chewing ability is improved by replacing edentulous areas with denture teeth.</li>
                        <li>Aesthetics, because the presence of teeth gives a natural appearance to the face, and wearing a denture to replace missing teeth provides support for the lips and cheeks and corrects the collapsed appearance that results from the loss of teeth.</li>
                        <li>Pronunciation, because replacing missing teeth, especially the anteriors, enables patients to speak better. There is especially improvement in pronouncing words containing sibilants or fricatives.</li>
                        <li>Self-esteem, because improved looks and speech boost confidence in the ability to interact socially.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-wrap">An alternative to dentures are dental implants.  They can be used to support cemented bridges, eliminating the need for a denture. The cost is usually greater, but the implants and bridges more closely resemble the feel of real teeth. Dental implants are becoming the alternative to a denture but not everyone is a candidate for implants.  In addition, implants can be used to anchor dentures.  This is an excellent alternative to fixed bridgework.  It can require as few as two implants.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Extractions</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">An extraction involves the removal of a tooth that cannot be saved.  We work hard at Avon Village Family Dentistry to save teeth.  Unfortunately, sometimes a tooth need to be removed if it cannot be restored, has lost bone support or is compromising other more important teeth.  We do many extractions in the office, including some third molars (wisdom teeth), as well as work with local oral surgeons when indicated.</p>
