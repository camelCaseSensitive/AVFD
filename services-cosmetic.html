                <h2>Teeth Whitening</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Teeth whitening is ideal for people who have healthy teeth.  Individuals with yellow tones to their teeth respond best. This cosmetic procedure is not recommended for everyone.  Ask us if teeth whitening is right for you.  We like to discuss the best method for each patient.</p>

                <h2>Invisalign</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">We are proud to be an Invisalign® Preferred Provider.  Invisalign® is an aesthetic alternative to traditional wire and bracket orthodontics (braces).  A series of clear aligners are used to safely move the teeth over a period of time.  Invisalign® can correct a number of orthodontic problems, such as crowding, spaces, and misaligned or rotated teeth. The system allows for optimum oral hygiene, because the aligners are removed for daily cleaning as well as for meals.</p>

                <p class="text-wrap">A customized treatment plan is created just for you…we will take x-rays, pictures and impressions of your teeth, which will be used to create a digital 3-D image. From this image we will map out a precise treatment plan, including the exact movements of your teeth, and tell you the approximate length of treatment. Using the same technology we will be able to show you a virtual representation of how your teeth will move with each stage of treatment.</p> 
                <p class="text-wrap">While every case is unique to each patient, treatment typically takes approximately a year for adults. For teens the length of treatments is comparable to that of braces. </p>
                <p class="text-wrap">Each patient receives several clear aligners at the beginning.  Each set of aligners advances the teeth.  These are changed approximately every two weeks, advancing to the next stage of treatment. To monitor your progress, you will have occasional checkups, usually only every six weeks or so. For best results and a timely outcome, clear aligners must be worn for 20 to 22 hours per day, throughout the entire treatment.  Each stage will bring you closer to having the smile that reflects the real you.</p>

                <h2>Veneers</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Veneers refers to thin pieces of porcelain which are bonded to the teeth to change the color and shape of the front teeth.  This procedure requires preparation of the teeth by removing a small amount to allow room for the porcelain.</p>

                <h2>Cosmetic Dental Bonding</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">While we use dental bonding as a restorative technique, we also offer cosmetic dental bonding which can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>improve the appearance of discolored teeth</li>
                    <li>close gaps between teeth</li>
                    <li>make the teeth look longer</li>
                    <li>change the shape of the teeth</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Cosmetic Dental Fillings</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Our office no longer uses silver fillings but instead utilizes a composite white filling instead. The composite is a synthetic combination of acrylic resin and glass which has a white color therefore enabling it to match the color of the tooth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Dentures</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">Dentures are appliances that can replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues.  They can replace some or all teeth and can help to restore your smile.  This appliance can be used to help fill out the appearance of your face and profile, and can be made to closely resemble the look of natural teeth.
                    <p class="text-wrap">Dentures can help patients through:</p>
                        <ul class="text-wrap">
                            <li>Mastication, as chewing ability is improved by replacing edentulous areas with denture teeth.</li>
                            <li>Aesthetics, because the presence of teeth gives a natural appearance to the face, and wearing a denture to replace missing teeth provides support for the lips and cheeks and corrects the collapsed appearance that results from the loss of teeth.</li>
                            <li>Pronunciation, because replacing missing teeth, especially the anteriors, enables patients to speak better. There is especially improvement in pronouncing words containing sibilants or fricatives.</li>
                            <li>Self-esteem, because improved looks and speech boost confidence in the ability to interact socially.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-wrap">An alternative to dentures are dental implants.  They can be used to support cemented bridges, eliminating the need for a denture. The cost is usually greater, but the implants and bridges more closely resemble the feel of real teeth. Dental implants are becoming the alternative to a denture but not everyone is a candidate for implants.  In addition, implants can be used to anchor dentures.  This is an excellent alternative to fixed bridgework.  It can require as few as two implants.</p>

            <div class="text-wrap" style="flex: 1;">
                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                <p class="text-wrap">A dental implant is a small titanium post that is surgically anchored in the jaw to replace a missing tooth.  After healing, when the implant fixture has integrated in the bone, a crown (tooth) is built on top of the post.  Implants offer an excellent solution for the replacement of a missing tooth.  They also can be used to replace multiple missing teeth as well as to support and stabilize dentures.  At Avon Village Family Dentistry, we perform the surgical placement of many dental implants or work in coordination with a local oral surgeon in some cases.</p>
